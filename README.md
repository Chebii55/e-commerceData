## Project Overview
This project was conducted as part of ABCâ€™s efforts to improve customer engagement with its digital product. The analysis focuses on understanding trends in customer behavior and identifying key drivers of engagement to guide strategic improvements. The Random Forest model was ultimately chosen as the best-performing model for predicting customer engagement.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing included:
- **Cleaning**: Handling missing values and removing outliers to ensure data quality.
- **Encoding**: Transforming categorical variables into numerical format to make them usable in machine learning models.
- **Standardization**: Ensuring consistency across features for more accurate modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved examining trends and relationships in the data to gain a preliminary understanding of customer behaviors. Key analysis areas included:
1. **Customer Demographics**: Insights into how age and gender correlate with engagement.
2. **Purchase Behavior**: Analysis of purchase frequency, transaction value, and churn patterns.
3. **Engagement Trends**: Identifying seasonal and temporal trends in purchases.

## Feature Engineering
To capture more nuanced insights into engagement, the following features were created:
- **Total Purchase Amount**: The total amount a customer has spent.
- **Yearly and Monthly Purchase Frequency**: Aggregated metrics representing customer purchase behavior.
- **Return Rate**: Frequency of returns, indicating potential dissatisfaction.
  
These engineered features were incorporated into the model, improving its ability to capture patterns in engagement.

## Modeling
After testing several models, Random Forest was selected as the optimal model for engagement prediction. The final evaluation metrics on the test data were as follows:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 2.143e-07
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 0.00046
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.00033
- **R-Squared**: 0.99999
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 0.00291%

## Key Findings
1. **Demographics**: Older customers have higher purchase values, while younger customers are more prone to churn.
2. **Product Insights**: High-value purchases are associated with lower return rates.
3. **Seasonal Trends**: Engagement tends to dip towards the end of the year, indicating a potential opportunity for seasonal campaigns.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed:
- **Seasonal Promotions**: Targeted marketing at the end of the year to counteract the dip in sales.
- **Demographic-Based Personalization**: Tailored engagement strategies for different age groups.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Incentives for frequent purchasers to boost engagement.
- **Product Refinement**: Focus on reducing returns for products with high return rates.
